Hello, i am Frederico Silva and i created the solution to this technical test.
This solution was created using Meteor.js, there were no restrictions on what to use in the file forwarded to me, i took the liberty to use this framework.

Why Meteor.js? Because
1.It allowed me to provide a solution completely on JS and JSON.
2.Easy to create  and code, the framework provides the tools to get the job done quickly and easily.
3.It provides it's own DB, Meteor integrates a DB and works both the front-end and back-end.

But it has its drawbacks:
1.the DB is a MongoDB
2.it has to be installed and runned on a machine that has the project to see the project

I provide the tools to quickly and easly instal Meteor.js .

Meteor Instalation:
1.Run the installer, it's available in the folowing link "https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Preview-of-Meteor-on-Windows"
2.Once completed call a Command Line has Administrator, write the folowing with out the comas "meteor update", you should be at version 1.2.1
3.Meteor is installed

Running the project:
1.Using the Command Line has Administrator, go into the folder where the project is located
2.To run the project write "meteor run"
3.the page is now accessible at "localhost:3000"
(another PC can also access the page, if you have the ip of the machine running the project)

Accessing the API
1.To have access to the API simple add to the URL "/my-api/StudentDetails"
it should look like "localhost:3000/my-api/StudentDetails"
You should see 2 entry in JSON, those are mine

if you wish to reset the DB
1.In the Command Line write "meteor reset"
