# DatabaseMeteorJS
Small solution using MeteorJS
This solution was all about creating a database and webpage, with the webpage i have a form to populate the database and a display for the top students in each subject by pressing the refresh button. When pressing submit there are no postbacks in the display. 
In addition the webpage provides an API for the data on the database. 
There's also a small CSS for a better presentation.
